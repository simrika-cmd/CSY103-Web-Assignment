In this site report I would like to explain about my learning process on web development. This report also has few of my experiences
on how I am learning and understanding web development module . I don't have much experience on html and CSS yet I have learned
about website making and how the code works on html and CSS file. Now I am capable of understanding and writing the codes by
knowing how it works . In this project I have also included my understandings. 

I have used simple designs and simple background colors . I havent made it flashy as I thought of keeping it simple and basic.
I also have used a clean layout. I took some references from various websites and decided to go for a modern layout and designs
as well as colors . I kept it simple as I didnt want it to look excessive as I decided to focus on simplicity.

Here another thing I learned from the web development is the <Header> , <nav> . This is what I considered important in the websites.
As it helped my website/code to manage properly. I learned almost everything . I learned how to style using CSS file where I 
was able to chane background colors , also I learnerd about how header and footer works. Another thing I learnt is about responsiveness
and making phone website. Phone websites are more easier to use for people so making one is very important as it helps to approach
other peoples too as for responsiveness it helped me on layouts including the phone layouts . CSS Grid was used to structure the layout,
 especially on the project page, where a different grid layout was applied to demonstrate my skills.

 Overall , I learned various things about websites. This web development has help me understand about layouts , designs and others.
 I also have improved on coding, problem solvings and styling. I have gained more skills on coding as well as it developed my
 knowledge on basic codes and debugs.
